# Prasart-Dang-Battle

This project is the clone repo of the final project for the *Programming Methodology I* course in Computer Engineering, Chulalongkorn University. This project was developed collaboratively with [@Suk-Nsr](https://github.com/Suk-Nsr).

The application is built using **Java** and **JavaFX**, with a strong emphasis on **Object-Oriented Programming** (**OOP**) principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
